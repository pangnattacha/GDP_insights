# Project: What insights can we tell from GDP per capita?

## Introduction
In this project, datasets of indicators were investigated in order to gain insights about GDP per capita. All the datasets were obtained from [GAPMINDER.ORG](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), which are information about many indicators showing how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years.

## Objective
To analyze a dataset and communicate the findings using Python and its libraries.

## Methodology
### Techonologies used
- Jupyter notebook (Python)
- Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
### Methodologies
- Data wrangling
  - Data gathering
  - Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Key finding
The datasets of GDP per capita and other indicators of interest were analyzed using Python. From this investigation, the change in economics over year across region could be seen, in which every regions show similar trends of economic growth while the highest income goes to Europe, following by Americas, Asia and Africa. The change in life expectancy increases over year, whereas some drops were observed. These drops in life expectancy can be influenced by many factors, such as, illness, wars, etc., which can be further explored. Population growth in exponential form, where Europe tends to depopulate the most. Depopulation is not yet the case for Africa. Moreover, life expectancy is high in high income regions. Urban population growth is more significant in low income regions. More importantly, long working hour does not always result in high income.
